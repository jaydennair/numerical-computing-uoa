# Numerical Computing Projects – University of Auckland

This repository contains a collection of programming assignments completed for ENGSCI 233: Computer Technology and Systems**, a core course in the Engineering Science programme at the University of Auckland (Semester One, 2025).

## Course Themes

- Python software development and clean code practices
- Numerical integration and differential equation solvers
- Data fitting, model validation, and error analysis
- Software testing with `pytest`
- MicroPython development for the BBC micro:bit V2
- Use of Git for version control and collaboration

## Assignments Included

Each assignment is organized in its own subfolder:

### 1. `Assignment1_IntroToPython/`
Fundamental Python functions with emphasis on return types, control flow, and error handling.

### 2. `Assignment2_MicrobitLEDDriver/`
A low-level MicroPython device driver and controller for the LED grid of the BBC micro:bit V2.

### 3. `Assignment3_Minesweeper/`
A full Python implementation of the classic Minesweeper game, including:
- Game logic
- Board display
- User interaction
- Unit testing using `pytest`

### 4. `Assignment5_NumericalComputation/`
Implementation of:
- Numerical precision/error analysis
- ODE solvers: Euler, Improved Euler, and Runge-Kutta (RK4)
- Accuracy and stability evaluations with visualizations

### 5. `Assignment6_DataFittingAndIntegration/`
Data analysis and numerical integration using:
- Least squares curve fitting
- Trapezoidal and Simpson's rules
- Error quantification and method comparison

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy
- MicroPython for micro:bit V2
- Git and GitHub for version control

## Academic Integrity

All code was written independently and submitted after the official assessment deadlines. This repository is public strictly for professional portfolio and educational purposes.
